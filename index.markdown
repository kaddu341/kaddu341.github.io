### Welcome to my website!

My name is Awwab Azam, and I am a junior at the University of Florida pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics, with a minor in Physics. I am particularly interested in machine learning and its applications to the basic sciences, as well as in mathematics and physics more broadly. Currently, I am working under Dr. Jiabin Yu to accelerate Hartreeâ€“Fock calculations for quantum many-body systems using deep learning.
