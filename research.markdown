### Machine Learning Acceleration for Hartree-Fock Calculations

- **PI Name:** Dr. Jiabin Yu
- **Institution and Department:** Department of Physics, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Florida
- **Timeline:** October 2024 - present
- **Research focus:**  The Hartree-Fock (HF) method is an important numerical approximation that is
widely used in quantum chemistry and physics to simulate the electronic structure of quantum
many-body systems. However, it gets very computationally expensive as the number of particles
grows. Our project focuses on using machine learning to develop an efficient alternative to the 
baseline HF algorithm for predicting the state of quantum systems.
- **Project responsibilities:** I am primarily responsible for the machine learning aspects of the project, including data preprocessing and postprocessing, as well as designing, implementing, and training neural networks, and fine-tuning their hyperparameters.
- **Media:**
